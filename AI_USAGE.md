# AI Tool Usage Disclosure

## Tools Used

- **Claude (Anthropic)** - AI assistant for code development, debugging, and documentation
- **ChatGPT** - For some questions

## Significant Contributions

### 1. Data Collection Module (`src/data_io/worldbank.py`)
- AI helped design the API client structure
- I implemented the CDI calculation logic myself
- I customized the error handling for African countries data

### 2. Machine Learning Models
- AI provided initial Ridge Regression boilerplate
- I configured hyperparameters based on my data characteristics
- I interpreted results and feature importance independently

### 3. Documentation
- AI assisted with README structure and formatting
- I wrote all project-specific content and analysis
- All economic interpretations are my own

## Learning Moments

- Used AI to understand scikit-learn's RidgeCV API
- Learned about proper missing value handling strategies
- Understood the difference between linear and non-linear models for economic data
- Discovered how to interpret feature importance in the context of African economies

## Code Understanding

I can explain and defend every line of code in this project. The AI was used as:
- A **learning tool** to understand best practices
- A **productivity booster** for boilerplate code
- A **debugging assistant** when encountering errors

All core logic, economic analysis, and project decisions are my own work.
